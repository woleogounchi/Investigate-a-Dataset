# Udacity - DAND - Project 3 - Investigate TMDB Movies Dataset -

## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
We will use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib in the data analysis process.

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

It will be recommend to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.


### Why this Project?
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fit together.


### What I have learn?
After completing the project, I have learned following :

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a usable format
* Develop the practice of communicating the analysis results
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which allows to access data in a more convenient way
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots
